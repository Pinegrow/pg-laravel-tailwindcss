# Vue Designer Laravel Jetstream Inertiajs Tailwind CSS - Quick start template

This is a starter template that pre-includes the [Pinegrow Vite Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pinegrow/vite-plugin), [Pinegrow Tailwind CSS Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pinegrow/tailwindcss-plugin) and other goodies for Vue Designer.

Demo - https://pg-laravel-tailwindcss.netlify.app/

This template has the PHP application server configured (instead of Vite which is used as a middleware) in Pinegrow Vite Plugin, to enable live-designing of Vue components of this laravel/inertia project. It also configures the custom folder setup & the default start-up page of the app.

```js
liveDesigner({
    devServerUrls: {
        local: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/",
    },
    dirs: {
      src: 'resources/js/',
      layouts: 'resources/js/Layouts',
      pages: 'resources/js/Pages',
      components: 'resources/js/Components',
    },
    startupPage: '@/Pages/Welcome.vue',
    //...
}),
```
